We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, 
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution 
for the United States of America.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

And for the support of this Declaration, 
with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, 
we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
